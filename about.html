                        <p>Hi, I'm Dan. Thank you for visiting my site! I am a front end web developer and UI/UX designer. I use HTML, CSS, Javascript,
                        React, and other tools to build apps and websites. For the last several months, I have been enrolled at the Nashville Software
                        School in their full-time front end development and UI/UX design bootcamp. Prior to that I owned my own business as a photographer
                        and have also been a teacher and have done freelance design work.</p>
                        <p>I received my Master of Fine Arts degree in photography
                        from the Savannah College of Art and Design and my Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art and Communications from Clark University
                        in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>Working in all of these facets of the creative process has informed how I approach web development.
                        It is very much a creative process, but one that does not begin with coding. It begins with the user and figuring out what
                        their needs are. I enjoy putting myself in the shoes of the user and figuring out the best way to achieve their objectives
                        and do it in a pleasing and meaningful way. We are in the business of helping people and solving problems. I am excited about
                        the challenge of taking those intentions and building a coding plan to make it happen, and then execute that plan with semantic
                        and modular code. . I have fun working with a team and bouncing ideas off each other. I love solving problems. Especially
                        difficult ones. Most importantly, I love learning and want to continue learning everything I can about about development
                        and design.</p>
