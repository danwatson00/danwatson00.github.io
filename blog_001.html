                    <p>Thank you for visiting my blog! This blog is going to a place for me to document my experiences in the Front End Web Development and UX/UI Designer program at the Nashville Software School. I am taking this course to improve my web development skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is a new adventure for me that I am excited to embark on.</p>
                    <p>Before I get too far in documenting my journey, I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and tell you a little about how I ended up getting into Front End Web Development. I have been an artist and photographer since I was in high school. In college I studied art, photography, design, and communications. After college, I went on teach photography and mathematics at a private co-educational school in New England. After two years of teaching I entered the Master of Fine Arts program at the Savannah College of Art and Design. There, I had my first formal web design training and I built my first website, a portfolio site for my photography. I learned a little HTML and Flash, but built most of the site using Adobe GoLive. I had little control and little understanding of what I was doing, but it worked and I was really excited to finally be live on the web.</p>
                    <p>After completing my Master of Fine Arts degree, I once again taught photography at a private school for a couple years and and at the same time I began my photography business. Owning my own business gave me the opportuntity to wear many hats from marketing director to accountant to customer sales rep, and everything in between. I quickly learned that if I wanted to stay in business, I had to take my website seriously and make sure I was presenting the right brand to the world through my site. Throughout my business, I've had many versions of my sites. It has been a great experience in reworking the same concept and improving the site year after year, as my brand and technology evolve. </p>
