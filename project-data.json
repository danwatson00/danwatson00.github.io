        "brief": "My Camera Bags is an app I created to help photographers organize their photography equipment and see what type of equipment other photographers are using. The mission of My Camera Bags is to organize the life of photographers, help them improve their photography skills, and help them earn a living with their photography equipment. Professional photographers often have several cameras and a significant amount of photography gear overall. Photographers typically don't take all of their gear when going on a shoot. Instead they will take just what they need in order to stay light and organized. Therefore, I thought it would be helpful to give photographers a way to create checklists in order to make sure they have the gear they need for a given shoot. The site was built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript using SASS, Browserify, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Grunt, and Photoshop.",

        "brief": "For this project, I was a part of a great team of developers and got to work on a fun and useful product for the Boys and Girls Club of Rutherford County. The project was for the Hack for the Community Event, which is an annual event in Nashville. Our team was honored to take home First Place for the app we made. The Boys and Girls Club wanted an app that could give the children simple, anonymous surveys about how they enjoyed their experiences at the Club. Prior to this event, The Boys and Girls Club only had the ability to give children surveys once per year and they were done on paper, so getting results took a long time as well. Our task was to create a mobile web app that would allow them to administer surveys weekly and get the resultinig data in a timely manner. The child-friendly web app uses simple questions and emoji-style answers to make it quick and easy for kids age 5 to 18. The backend included comprehensive reporting the administrators could access anytime. I was one of two front end developers along with five back end developers, two designers, and QA analyst, and a project manager. I was charged with styling the user interface and helping to make the app functional. It was a great experience working with all of those talented designers and developers.",

With the tight deadline, we had to prioritize our MVP (minimum viable product) and done as much as possible. As a part of the group, I was in charge of creating the collapsible containers that would hold the news and weather. I was also responsible for getting the data from the weather api using FETCH. It was a great project to work on to learn how to use Reactstrap and FETCH with React. What wasn't completed as a group, I intend to continue on my own, so check back for updates soon.",
