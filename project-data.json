        "brief": "My Camera Bags is an app I created to help photographers organize their photography equipment and see what type of equipment other photographers are using. The mission of My Camera Bags is to organize the life of photographers, help them improve their photography skills, and help them earn a living with their photography equipment. Professional photographers often have several cameras and a significant amount of photography gear overall. Photographers typically don't take all of their gear when going on a shoot. Instead they will take just what they need in order to stay light and organized. Therefore, I thought it would be helpful to give photographers a way to create checklists in order to make sure they have the gear they need for a given shoot. The site was built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript using SASS, Browserify, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Grunt, and Photoshop.",
